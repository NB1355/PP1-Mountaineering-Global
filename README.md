# MOUNTAINEERING GLOBAL

## Offering professional services for photography in the mountains.

This website is developing in parallel to forming a new business idea that combines mountaineering and 
professional photography services for experts interested in crossing over to the other domain. 
Using only HTML 5 and CSS 3 is the first choice to get a static responsive website running fast.
