# MOUNTAINEERING GLOBAL

## Offering professional services for photography in the mountains.

This website is developing in parallel to forming a new business idea that combines mountaineering and 
professional photography services for experts interested in crossing over to the other domain. 
Using only HTML 5 and CSS 3 is the first choice to get a static responsive website running fast.

after passing dev tests, deployment to the final environment is done.

* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch.
* Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
* commits show the transfer from dev and resolving minor issues at the end
